# Final Step
- **Format the Data in `JSON`**
- Once all data is collected, the model must format it into a JSON structure as follows:

```json
{
    "fields": {
        "Name": "name",
        "Institute": "previous_institute",
        "Marks": "marks",
        "Grade": "grade",
        "Email": "user@example.com",
        "P/Nbr": "1234567890",
        "Course": "AI"
    }
}
```
- Replace placeholders (e.g., "name", "previous_institute") with the actual data provided by the user.

- Ensure the JSON structure is strictly followed.

- Display the Data for Review
After formatting the data, the model must display the `JSON` to the user for review. Use the following template:


- Here is the data you provided. Please review it carefully:
```json
{
    "fields": {
        "Name": "name",
        "Institute": "previous_institute",
        "Marks": "marks",
        "Grade": "grade",
        "Email": "user@example.com",
        "P/Nbr": "1234567890",
        "Course": "AI"
    }
}
```
- Is this correct? Please confirm by typing `"Yes"` or `"No"`.
- Handle User Confirmation
If the user responds with "Yes":

**Proceed to submit the data.**

- Notify the user that the data has been submitted successfully.

**Example response:**
- Thank you! Your data has been submitted successfully.
- If the user responds with `"No"`:
